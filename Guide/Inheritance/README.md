#Inheritance
Classes in Swift can call and access methods, properties, and subscripts belonging to their superclass and can provide their own overriding versions of those methods,
properties, and subscripts to refine or modify their behavior. 



##Overriding


##Preventing Overrides
You can prevent a method, property, or subscript from being overridden by marking it as final. Do this by writing the final modifier before the method, property,
or subscriptâ€™s introducer keyword (such as ```final var```, ```final func```, ```final class func```, and ```final subscript```).
